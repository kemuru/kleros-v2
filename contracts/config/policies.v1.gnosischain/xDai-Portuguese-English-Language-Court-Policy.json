  "name": "xDai Portuguese-English Translation",
  "description": "**Court purpose** \n\n In this court, jurors will solve disputes involving the quality of translations between Portuguese and English.",
  "summary": "",
  "requiredSkills": "Jurors in this court should have a strong command of both English and Portuguese. While jurors do not necessarily have to have the skills of a professional translator themselves, they should be able to review texts translated between English and Portuguese for the quality of their translation. Particularly, when presented with passages that are flagged by challengers as potentially erroneous or inadequate and arguments given by the translator and the challenger for why the passage should or should not be considered acceptable, jurors should be able to make a determination on the quality of the passage. Jurors should be capable of these tasks even when the text is being translated to or from regional variations of these languages, such as US/British English, or Brazilian/European Portuguese."
